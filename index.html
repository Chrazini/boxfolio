                <p>The first flow was about imagining our first portfolio and working within Adobe XD for the first time. While I did create a working prototype, my actual portfolio didn't come to look anything like it. Unfortunately, I completed the assignment without any prototype interactivity. This was the main feedback as well, which is why I've gone ahead and made functional buttons and added a quick way to go back to the homepage.</p>

                <p>The original portfolio was similar in design but was programmed very differently.

The amount of content shown at a time has been increased and browsing the actual portfolio has been made a lot easier.</p>
                <p>After a reasonably comprehensive user test it was evident that my old portfolio didn't include enough content, was too bland in design, didn't work on all devices and screen sizes and content, material and articles was challenging to read due to the small frame size of the website. I've tried to tackle all these issues.</p><a class="button" href="downloads/flow-2.pdf" target="_blank">Original Assignment

                <p>Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish this assignment in time, so instead of altering my the last assignment, I have instead decided to create a whole new app and new design from scratch. The application is built for a relatively new physical store concept where customers can rent physical shelf space and sell their second-hand items. This application helps customers with booking, checking what items have been sold and how much money they've made. It's also possible to withdraw money directly from the application.</p>

                <p>The landing page we had worked on for the world campaign had already gone from prototype to an actual website. The site did, however, not work very well on smaller devices and wasn't build to be very responsive in general. Despite the responsiveness not being optimal, the website worked pretty well and got limited feedback. The main criticism was the fact that the header on top of the splash image could be challenging to read in certain situations.</p>
                <p>The new landing page should be a lot more responsive, and the readability of the text should be a lot better as well.

          <h2>Videos</h2>
          <aticle>
            <p>While the following videos might seem random or out of place of the portfolio, I took to chance to practise my filmmaking and video editing capabilities on something more concrete. I have recorded and edited a series of videos that are to be used in a family quiz for my grandmothers 90th birthday. Together, the videos have required a lot of careful planning, research and editing. While you might be missing some context, I think the videos alone is an excellent showcase of what I've learned over the first semester on CPH Business.</p>
            <p>According to the assignment, there weren't any direct requirements for the video segment, so I'm very hopeful this will suffice.</p>

          <article>
            <h4>Source Code</h4>
            <p>The portfolio has been created from scratch using Pug for the HTML, Sass for the CSS and some Javascript. The reason behind using these pre-processors is the intuitiveness and feature-rich arsenal that they provide. The website has been coded using multiple sub-pages for the sake of organisation. These pages have then been compiled into one HTML file and one CSS file. To optimise the website even further, the code has been so-called "minified" upon compilation which makes the data faster to read for the browser, but more challenging to read for humans - to see the actual source code before compilation, go to my GitHub page below.</p><a class="button" href="#" target="_blank">GitHub - Source Code
              <div class="square"><img src="images/icons/github.svg"></div></a>
            <h4>Features & Compatibility</h4>
            <p>The website is using the newest HTML5 and CSS3 - this means that I have been using features such a flexbox, the relatively new grid system, advanced selectors, animations and transitions, variables, media queries and much more to create a dynamic and exciting website.</p>
            <p>The site has been created with the three most prominent browsers in mind, namely Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Due to the lack of any Apple devices, I was unable to test and enhance the website for the Apple Safari browser.</p>

          <p class="manchet"> What have I learned over the course of my first semester as a multimedia designer on CPH Business? I will go over each flow or "chapter" in the semester and provide a few thoughts and reflections on each of them. I will delve into what I expected from the flow, what actually happened during the flow, and how it helped me improve my toolkit for the future.

              <div class="extralight">"Drøm dit Portfolio"</div> Dream your Portfolio
            </h4>
            <p>The first flow of the first semester was all about hands-on and getting to experience programs like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe XD. Photo manipulating and the use of various tools in Adobe Photoshop was the key in this flow. To end it all off, a prototype of your "dream" portfolio had to be constructed to be used in the future flow.</p>
            <p>A lot of hands-on photo editing and manipulating was taught in class as well as a guide on how to use Adobe XD - a program that is used to bring your imagination to life by creating design prototypes before starting your programming journey.</p>

                <summary class="tiny">Expectations:</summary>
                <p>I expected to get a slightly better feel for Adobe Photoshop during this flow and perhaps familiarise myself with a few more of the numerous tools it has to offer. I was also looking forward to finally working with Adobe XD and create my initial sketch for my upcoming portfolio site.</p>

              <details class="grid-item">
                <summary class="tiny">Reflections:</summary>
                <p>The academic expectations were somewhat low, as it was the first semester and very first flow - that means my designer toolkit wasn't significantly expanded upon in this flow. And while we didn't exactly invent the wheel in this flow, I did discover what a great tool Adobe XD was, which is something I will continue to use in my career.</p>
                <p>It is, however, something I have to get used to. Sketching out a prototype before starting work is not something I'm used to as I like to get straight to business and start designing and coding right off the bat. There are endless downsides to this approach, however. I will absolutely attempt to use Adobe XD for as many projects as I can in the future.</p>

                <p>I expected to take what we had from the first flow and put it into practice in this flow. I was hoping to learn slightly more practical approaches to be able to create my portfolio from scratch. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                  <li>IDE's</li>

                </ul>
                <p>I also expected to learn some "best practises" in terms of programming and managing a more significant project that contains a vast amount of files.</p>

                <p>As fun as it is creating a great prototype using Adobe XD - actually programming and designing a proper website is something else. I have experience working with HTML, CSS, and to some extent, Javascript. I think the actual "classroom teaching" was a bit bland, and didn't exactly give me much to work with. If I had no experience in terms of web design, I think I would have struggled a lot with creating a portfolio from scratch. However, this flow was great for me - while I didn't learn anything new in terms of programming, I did do a lot of research myself to expand my knowledge. I can easily say that web design is my favourite part of being a multimedia designer so far.</p>
                <p>Something I did learn was optimising images for web use and various layout principles that I could use to make my portfolio even better.</p>

            <p>In the third flow we were tasked to develop a mobile application. Through data collection, personas and various tests, we had to create ideas and design a prototype of an application using Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe XD - the final product had to be showcased via Adobe XD. The following qualifications were to be acquired during this flow:</p>

                <p>The way I understand flow three is that it was all about the users, clients, consumers, customers - you name it. It was not design just for the sake of design, but instead usability and approachability. We learned to critique our designs and utilise user tests to find flaws and mistakes.</p>
                <p>Once again, we got to work with Adobe XD as we had to create a mobile application from scratch, this time, with great focus on the users. We also touched subjects such as:</p>

            <h4>Flow 4 -
              <div class="extralight">"Verdenmålskampagne"</div> World Campaign
            </h4>
            <p>In flow four, we were tasked to create a world campaign for a company of our own choice. The only requirement was that the company had a publically available style guide. The assignment itself was to create a landing page for the campaign in either Adobe XD or actually program it using HTML and CSS. It was also a requirement to create a somewhat short video sequence that would accommodate the campaign.</p>
            <p>Project management, designs briefs and visual identity played a considerable role in this flow - as well as the following qualification requirements:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Design guide implementation.</li>
              <li>Video production and storytelling.</li>
              <li>Deep understanding of project management.</li>
              <li>Work in smaller teams.</li>
            </ul>

                <summary class="tiny">Expectations:</summary>
                <p>I didn't know exactly what to expect from this flow. I knew it was about project management which wasn't something I had done before. I was hoping to expand my knowledge on how to handle and operate more significant projects with multiple people as this flow was a group project.</p>
                <p>A significant part of this flow was a video sequence, so I definitely expected a lot of hands-on video editing and theory on the subject.</p>

                <summary class="tiny">Reflections:</summary>
                <p>My initial thoughts about this flow were not entirely positive, as these kinds of subjects are often very theoretical - and as a designer, you can also do so much theoretical stuff before you get bored. It was, however, not as I expected. While we did have to sit through hours of slides shows and talks, we did get a lot of crucial information.</p>
                <p>We learned to utilise charts such as "objective breakdown structure", "product breakdown structure" and "work breakdown structure". These are common ways of calculating and organising the time spend on a more significant project - which was important as this flow was completed in groups.</p>

            <h4>Flow 5 -
              <div class="extralight">"Eksamensprojekts"</div> Exam Project
            </h4>
            <p>The purpose of this flow is to present and document my progression over the semester as well as showcase my work and show what I've produced throughout the first semester. Based on what I've learned during the first semester, I must develop a website that makes up my current portfolio. The new portfolio will serve as a showcase for what I have worked on and what the future may contain. The portfolio is a face to the public and must show who I am and what I can do for potential companies, classmates, teachers and more.</p>
            <p>The design must demonstrate my skills in design, visualisation and interaction development. Documentation of the progress must be demonstrated using project management techniques such as PBS, WBS and OBS. It's crucial to take concrete and consistent decisions in terms of the portfolios visual expression and identity - this includes the style, colours, layout, icons, logo and general mood. It is therefore essential that the design choices and principles can be justified using models and methods learned over the first semester.</p>
            <p>Besides the portfolio, a video sequence must also be included in the portfolio and part of the presentation. Design decisions and development must be justified and stated in the portfolio in the form of subpages, documents or a video.</p>
            <p>The portfolio should present the learning in a way that can be directly and chronologically seen in the development. Reflection questions that can be used when working are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What did I learn during this course?</li>
              <li>What did I expect to learn?</li>
              <li>What do I need to improve on?</li>
              <li>What will I do to improve on that?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The website must be developed from the ground up using the knowledge you've gained throughout the first semester. It is not allowed to use any kind of content management systems or CSS frameworks of any kind.</p>
            <div class="auto-grid">
              <details class="grid-item">
                <summary class="tiny">Expectations:</summary>
                <p>My expectations during the last flow were extremely high. I wanted to use everything I knew about design and put it into a website. I set incredibly high goals for myself, which made every second count during this flow.</p>
                <p>I expect to rework a lot of things during the actual design process as newer and better solutions become more visible. </p>
                <p>I'm going to be spending a lot of time planning and researching for this final project, and I want to aim a lot higher than what is expected from me.</p>

                <p>Flow five has been the most challenging flow by far. This flow tries to take everything we've learned into one single package. This results in a very dense assignment with a lot of things to do in a relatively short amount of time. It has, however, been the most educational flow by far. I have done vast amounts of research, considerable planning and put in a lot of work to create what you see on this page.</p>
                <p>The portfolio has gone through numerous iterations, and I started back from scratch around four times in total. It's been stressful, but also fantastic to be able to use everything you've learned. It has also been exciting working with video editing and illustrative work.</p>
